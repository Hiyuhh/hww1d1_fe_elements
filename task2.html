        <h3>Resist the lure, steer clear of Shrek's allure.</h3>
        <p>
            Ah, Shrek, the ogre with a heart of swamp muck! Sure, he's got layers like an onion, but some of those layers are downright rotten! 
            Like that time he swooped in and whisked Fiona away from poor Lord Farquaad. Talk about a plot twist that even the fairy godmother didn't see coming! 
            And let's not forget about Farquaad, bless his vertically challenged soul. If only he had a step stool handy, maybe he could have handled his princess predicament 
            himself without needing Shrek's oversized help! But no, he had to rely on Shrek, the big, burly brute, to do the dirty work. And don't even get me started on the height jokes, 
            poor Farquaad couldn't catch a break! In the end, Shrek's escapades may be entertaining, but let's not forget the questionable morals and the constant ribbing at poor Farquaad's expense.
